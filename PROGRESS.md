# wi — BUILD PROGRESS

Working log for the autonomous build loop. Source of truth for *intent*; the real
build state is always `go build ./... && go test ./...` (trust the build over this file).

Branch: `build/wi` (never commit to `main`). Spec: `DESIGN.md`. Order: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

---

## Current position

- **Milestone:** **M2 in progress** (domain command core: `config`, `state`, `isolate`, `resolve`).
  `internal/config` read+validate, `internal/state` per-isolate registry record, the two `internal/git`
  isolate primitives (`AddWorktree` + `CreateOwnedRef`/`OwnedRefSHA`), AND now **`internal/isolate.New`**
  — the N-repo orchestration that drives `AddWorktree` + `CreateOwnedRef` + `state.UpdateRepoStage` per
  repo under the `isolate-state:<task>` lock, stop-on-first-fail with durable, not-rolled-back completed
  repos (DESIGN §6.3) — all landed and green. **Next: `resolve`** (the path bundle that projects an
  isolate's repo paths into the `resolve` envelope block) — which COMPLETES M2 and unlocks M3
  (`cli`/`help`/`suggest` + `cmd/wi` → MVP end-to-end). A `isolate.New` resume refinement (skip repos
  already `StageCreated` on re-run) and likely state follow-ons (namespaced KV + `cas`) remain, pulled in
  when a command needs them.
  M0 + M1 complete: contract spine, layout, opid, clock, testenv, lockfs, lock, `gitexec` runner+belt,
  full `internal/git` (resolve / ff / EnsureClone / IsClean / Fetch / DivergedCounts), complete
  `internal/mirror`, and both DESIGN §2 architecture invariants (INV-NO-LLM + INV-NO-NETWORK).
- **Wave:** A complete (modulo `NORM-CORRECT`, deferred to Wave B); in Wave B domain code (M2).

## Done

- **M0/A · contract enums** — `internal/contract/enums.go`: closed sets `Action` (6),
  `ErrorKind` (11), `ExitCode` (9), `Capability` (10 vocab / 4 advertised) + `SchemaVersion`.
  Guard `SHAPE-ENUM-DOUBLE-ENTRY` (`enums_test.go`): independent literal copies; drift /
  duplicate / subset checks; inline non-vacuity proof. Real-source mutant (added `"timeout"`
  to `AllErrorKinds`) confirmed RED, then reverted → GREEN.
- **M0/A · Envelope wire type** — `internal/contract/envelope.go`: the `Envelope` struct with
  locked field declaration order + custom `MarshalJSON` enforcing `error:null` (never omitted)
  and `repos`/`capabilities`/`warnings`/`next` always-`[]` (never null). Nested wire types
  `RepoResult`, `MirrorFreshness`, `Warning`, `Error`, `ResolveBlock`, `ResolveRepo`, `PlanItem`,
  `BlockItem` (additive blocks `resolve`/`planned`/`blocked` are omitempty per DESIGN §3.1).
  Guard `SHAPE-ENVELOPE-INVARIANTS` (`envelope_test.go`): golden success/error bytes,
  error-always-present, repos-always-array, frozen 11-key top-level order + a non-vacuous
  order-extractor proof. Mutant (added `,omitempty` to `Error`) confirmed RED on
  `TestEnvelopeGoldenSuccess`/`TestEnvelopeErrorAlwaysPresent`, then reverted → GREEN.
- **M0/A · WarningCode closed vocab** (open decision #1, RESOLVED) — `internal/contract/enums.go`:
  closed `WarningCode` set `{hydrate_skipped, base_behind_ssot}` + `AllWarningCodes()`; `Warning.Code`
  retyped `string`→`WarningCode`. Extended `SHAPE-ENUM-DOUBLE-ENTRY` (`wantWarningCodes` +
  `TestWarningCodeDoubleEntry` + uniqueness). Real-source mutant (`"stray_mutant"`) confirmed RED,
  reverted → GREEN. Staleness deliberately NOT a warning — it lives in `mirror_freshness.stale`.
- **M0/A · Envelope JSON Schema SSOT** — `schema/envelope.schema.json` (draft 2020-12,
  `additionalProperties:false`, all 11 top-level keys `required` incl. `error`, closed enums for
  action/capability/error.kind/warning.code, `schema_version` const `"1.0"`). Embedded via new
  `package schema` (`schema/schema.go`, `//go:embed`) for the future `wi schema` command + test use.
  First external dep: `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` (test-only import; benign transitive
  `x/text`,`regexp2`). Guard `SHAPE-SCHEMA` (`internal/contract/schema_test.go`): both goldens
  validate; a 7-case malformed corpus (extra key, missing `error`, bad enums, wrong version, null
  repos) is rejected; + non-vacuity proof that the validator still accepts the known-good golden.
  Mutant (top-level `additionalProperties:true`) confirmed RED on `TestSchemaRejectsInvalid`,
  reverted → GREEN. **Decision:** reserved additive blocks (`land_state`/`ports`/`hooks`/`tethers`)
  are NOT pre-declared — added to schema+struct together at their milestone (minor bump) so the
  upcoming `SHAPE-FINGERPRINT` schema↔struct tripwire stays exact.
- **M0/A · SHAPE-FINGERPRINT + contract.lock.json** — `internal/contract/fingerprint_test.go` +
  `internal/contract/testdata/contract.lock.json`. One frozen tripwire over the whole contract:
  `SchemaVersion` + sha256(schema bytes) + a reflection-derived canonical `struct_shape` (json tags
  incl. `,omitempty`, recursing through pointers/slices/nested types) + its sha256. The lock file IS
  the fingerprint (env-gated regen via `WI_UPDATE_CONTRACT_LOCK=1`); **decision:** no duplicate Go
  `SchemaFingerprint` const, to avoid double-maintenance. `TestFingerprintIsNonVacuous` proves the
  shape extractor catches added field / retype / omitempty change. Real-source mutant (added a
  `Mutant string` field tagged `json:"-"`) confirmed it turns ONLY `TestContractFrozen` RED while the
  marshal/golden tests stay green — exactly the silent-drift class the fingerprint exists to catch.
  Reverted → GREEN. **Wave A contract spine is now structurally complete** (schema/struct/enums all
  guarded + locked); remaining Wave-A write-first items are INV-NO-LLM, META-VACUITY, NORM-CORRECT.

- **M0/A · INV-NO-LLM** — `internal/invariants` (new package owning DESIGN §2 architecture guards).
  `nollm_test.go` walks the module graph (`go.mod` + `go.sum`, the full transitive closure) and
  fails if any curated LLM/agent-SDK token appears in a module path; pure `scanForDenylisted` +
  cwd-walk-up `moduleRoot`. `TestNoLLMScannerIsNonVacuous` exercises the same detector on a synthetic
  `go-openai` line. Real-source mutant (appended a `// ...go-openai` comment to `go.mod`) confirmed
  `TestNoLLMDependencies` RED (flagged `[openai go-openai]`), reverted via `git checkout` → GREEN.
- **M0/A · WI_FAULT harness + META-VACUITY** — `internal/fault`: the deterministic fault-injection
  seam (`fault.Active(id)` reading the `WI_FAULT` env, exact per-entry match; inert when unset) that
  future HEAL/crash guards consult so their mutant is "set `WI_FAULT=<id>`" rather than a source edit
  — the harness IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §2 lists as a Wave-A deliverable. `META-VACUITY`
  (`meta_vacuity_test.go`) re-execs the test binary to run a reference guard twice: under
  `WI_FAULT=meta.reference` it MUST fail (a fault can redden a guard), with no fault it MUST pass.
  Unit test `TestActiveIn` pins exact (non-substring) matching. Real-source mutant (made `refSubject`
  ignore the fault) confirmed `TestMetaVacuity` RED ("harness is vacuous"), reverted → GREEN.
- **Wave A is COMPLETE** (modulo `NORM-CORRECT`, intentionally deferred to Wave B): contract spine
  (enums/envelope/schema/fingerprint-lock), INV-NO-LLM, and the WI_FAULT/META-VACUITY methodology
  harness are all in and green. M0 now proceeds to its non-contract packages.
- **M0 · `internal/layout` (path core)** — `layout.go` + `layout_test.go`: `Layout` is the SOLE
  owner of every wi path (DESIGN §1, §4). `New(absRoot)` (cleans, requires absolute) + accessors
  `Root/Config/ReposDir/IsolasDir/WiDir`, the seven `.wi/` subtree dirs
  (`locks/state/log/mirrors/land/ports/trust` via one `WiSubdirs()` SSOT), and the input-bearing
  `Repo/TaskDir/Isolate`. `validSegment` is the chokepoint blocking traversal: rejects
  empty / `.` / `..` / path-separator (either flavor) / NUL / absolute, so user repo/task names
  can't escape the tree. Guards `LAYOUT-PATHS` (hand-written golden relative paths — independent
  copy of the scheme) + `LAYOUT-SAFE` (reject corpus + an accept floor). Mutants confirmed:
  `isolas`→`isolate` → `TestPaths` RED; `validSegment`→always-nil → reject cases RED; →always-error
  → accept floor RED. All reverted → GREEN. **Deferred to the post-`testenv` unit:** `Bootstrap`
  (mkdir the `.wi/` subtree) + EvalSymlinks root normalization — both need an existing on-disk root,
  so they wait for the real-FS `internal/testenv` harness (also M0).

- **M0 · `internal/cli/opid` (op-id format)** — `opid.go` + `opid_test.go`: mints/validates the one
  volatile envelope field (DESIGN §2/§3.1/§8). Root id `op_<base36ts>_<base32rand>` (ts = Unix
  millis base36; rand = 5 bytes → 8 chars lowercase unpadded base32), child suffix `.<n>` (n≥1,
  nests). `New(now, io.Reader)` is pure/deterministic (reads exactly `randLen`, errors on short read
  — never truncates); `Child`; `Valid` over a frozen regex. **Decisions recorded** (#A below): ms
  time unit, 5 random bytes, n≥1 no-leading-zero child index. Guard `OPID-FORMAT` pins the shape from
  independent angles (zero-bytes→`"aaaaaaaa"` pins the base32 encoding; inverse `ParseInt(base36)`
  pins base + ms unit; reject corpus + accept floor). Mutants confirmed: `UnixMilli`→`Unix`,
  `randLen` 5→4, prefix `op_`→`wi_` all → RED. Reverted → GREEN.

- **M0 · `internal/clock` (time/rand seam)** — `clock.go` + `clock_test.go`: the `Clock` interface
  (`Now() time.Time` + `Rand() io.Reader`) funnels wi's two volatile inputs (DESIGN §2 determinism,
  §4). `System` = real UTC time + `crypto/rand` (a local syscall, honors no-hidden-network §2.3);
  `Fake(instant, seed)` = fixed advanceable instant + a self-contained splitmix64 byte stream
  (`detReader`, ours not `math/rand` so the sequence is stable across stdlib changes; never
  short-reads). Guard `CLOCK-DETERMINISM` pins reproducible (same seed → same stream + same op_id via
  `opid.New`), seed-sensitive (diff seed → diff stream), non-degenerate (not all-zero), and System
  live (UTC + crypto/rand varies). Mutants confirmed: `Fake.Rand`→`crypto/rand` → reproducible RED;
  `NewFake` ignores seed → seed-sensitive RED. Reverted → GREEN. (Compile-time `var _ Clock` for both
  impls.)

- **M0 · `internal/testenv` (hermetic real-git harness)** — `testenv.go` + `testenv_test.go`: the
  sandbox every FS/git unit test runs inside (PLAN §M0). `New(t)` → an `Env` with an
  EvalSymlinks-normalized `t.TempDir` root + a fully isolated git environment; `Git(t,dir,args…)`
  runs git under it (fails on non-zero, returns trimmed stdout); `SeedOrigin(t,name)` makes a bare
  origin with one deterministic commit on `main` (local `clone --bare`, no network). Isolation:
  `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`SYSTEM`=`/dev/null` + `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, fixed identity + fixed
  author/committer **dates** (reproducible SHAs), `LC_ALL=C` (stable git English), no prompt/no net.
  Guard `TESTENV-HERMETIC`: pins an **absolute golden base SHA** (`48f4258c…`, sha1) — fully
  determined by identity+dates+content+message — plus injected author identity + symlink-normalized
  root. Mutants confirmed: drop fixed dates → SHA ≠ golden RED; drop `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` → ambient
  username (`admin`) leaks → identity RED. **Note:** a relative "two runs agree" determinism check
  was rejected as vacuous (same-second SHA collision); the absolute golden is the real pin. `RunWI`
  deferred to M3 (needs the built binary).

- **M0 · `internal/lockfs` flock half** — `flock_unix.go` (`//go:build unix`) + `flock_unix_test.go`:
  `FileLock`, the advisory whole-file `flock(2)` lock that serializes concurrent `wi` processes
  touching the same `.wi/` resource (DESIGN §6.1). `NewFileLock(path)` + `TryLock()` (non-blocking,
  `(bool,err)`) / `Lock()` (blocking) / `Unlock()` (idempotent no-op when not held); double-lock of a
  held handle is a usage error. Built on `syscall.Flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` — **decision #6 flock leg
  RESOLVED: hand-rolled on stdlib `syscall.Flock`, NOT `gofrs/flock`** (zero new deps, INV-NO-LLM
  stays trivially green; PID/self-heal layer is hand-written regardless). Kernel releases the lock on
  process exit, so a crashed holder never wedges it. Guard `FLOCK-EXCLUDES` exploits BSD flock's
  per-open-file-description semantics to prove exclusion in-process (two independent handles contend):
  TryLock refuses a second holder + frees on Unlock; blocking Lock waits then proceeds after release.
  Mutant (`LOCK_EX`→`LOCK_SH`) confirmed `TestFlockExcludesSecondHolder` + `TestLockBlocksUntilReleased`
  RED (shared locks coexist). Reverted → GREEN. Auto-lock-break self-heal (§7.3) is a separate M4 unit.

- **M0 · `internal/layout` Bootstrap + Resolve** — `layout.go` + `bootstrap_test.go`: the two
  filesystem-aware constructors completing the layout package. `Resolve(root)` is the
  EvalSymlinks-normalized constructor the CLI uses at startup (DESIGN §4) — requires an existing
  absolute root, resolves every symlink so the canonical root is a fixed point (matters on macOS:
  /var → /private/var). `(l Layout) Bootstrap()` materializes the `.wi/` runtime subtree (WiDir + all
  7 `WiSubdirs`) and writes a self-ignoring `.wi/.gitignore` (`*\n`) so runtime state can never be
  committed (DESIGN §1) without wi touching the user's ignore files; idempotent. **First real consumer
  of `lockfs.WriteFileAtomic`** — dogfoods the §6.2 single-writer invariant. Guard `LAYOUT-BOOTSTRAP`:
  symlinked-root resolution + fixed-point, relative/missing-root rejection, subtree+gitignore creation,
  idempotency. Mutants confirmed: skip the WiSubdirs loop → `TestBootstrapCreatesSubtree` RED
  (`.wi/locks` missing); drop EvalSymlinks (`return New(root)`) → `TestResolveNormalizesSymlinks` RED
  (link unresolved) **and** the missing-root reject RED (proving the existence guard comes from
  EvalSymlinks). Reverted → GREEN. **`internal/layout` is now complete** (path core + Bootstrap +
  Resolve).

- **M0 · `internal/lockfs` atomic writer** — `atomic.go` + `atomic_test.go`: `WriteFileAtomic(path,
  data, perm)`, the SINGLE atomic writer every `.wi/` state writer reuses (DESIGN §6.2). Recipe:
  `os.CreateTemp` in the SAME dir (rename stays intra-fs ⇒ atomic) → write → fsync → chmod to the
  caller's mode (CreateTemp gives 0600; Chmod dodges umask) → close → `os.Rename` over the target →
  `fsyncDir` the parent so the rename itself is durable. Failure paths remove the temp and leave the
  target untouched. **First consumer of the `WI_FAULT` seam:** `FaultBeforeRename`
  (`lockfs.before_rename`) aborts in the exact temp-written-but-not-renamed window. Guard
  `HEAL-ATOMIC-WRITE` (plain `t.TempDir`, no git ⇒ no `testenv` needed): content+perm round-trip;
  **crash-safety** — under the injected fault the target keeps its complete OLD content (never torn)
  and no temp turds remain; two-sided floor that an un-faulted replace DOES apply. Mutant (in-place
  `O_TRUNC` write instead of temp+rename) confirmed `TestAtomicReplaceIsCrashSafe` RED (target torn to
  `"v2…"`), reverted → GREEN. flock advisory-lock half is a separate follow-up unit.

- **M0 · `internal/lock` (lock-key namespace + total-order acquire)** — `keys.go` + `acquire.go`
  (+ `keys_test.go`, `acquire_test.go`): the SOLE owner of wi's advisory lock-key namespace, built on
  `lockfs.FileLock` (DESIGN §6.1). Closed namespace: `project-registry`, `repo:<name>` (the key sync
  AND land both take — this is what linearizes their freshness race), `isolate-state:<task>`.
  Constructors `ProjectRegistry()`/`Repo(name)`/`IsolateState(task)` route names through the new
  exported `layout.ValidateSegment` (one shared traversal chokepoint — keys become lock filenames), and
  a `Key` derives its own `.lock` path so callers never assemble lock paths. `Acquire(locksDir, keys…)`
  folds the set into `orderedUnique` order (sorted+deduped) and TryLocks each non-blocking:
  all-or-nothing — a held key rolls back the partial acquire and returns typed `*HeldError` (→ exit 6
  `lock_held`), never blocks, never double-grants; `Held.Release()` frees in reverse, idempotent.
  Guards: `LOCK-KEYS` (pinned canonical strings + path derivation + unsafe-name rejection),
  `LOCK-ORDER` (`orderedUnique` is order-independent + dedups), `LOCK-MUTEX` (overlap refused with
  `*HeldError` naming the key; partial-failure rollback proven via fresh re-acquire). All four mutants
  confirmed RED: no-op sort comparator → `TestOrderedUnique…` RED; treat refused TryLock as success →
  `TestAcquireRefusesOverlap` RED; skip rollback on refusal → `TestAcquireReleasesOnPartialFailure` RED;
  `repo:`→`repository:` → `TestCanonicalKeyStrings` RED. Reverted → GREEN. Auto-lock-break self-heal
  (§7.3) stays a separate M4 unit. **M0 building blocks are now complete** (contract spine + layout +
  opid + clock + testenv + lockfs + lock).

- **M1 · `internal/gitexec` (runner + egress belt)** — `gitexec.go` + `gitexec_test.go`: the single
  chokepoint that launches every git child process (DESIGN §4, §2.3). `Runner` (New = inherit env;
  NewWithEnv = explicit hermetic base) with `Run` (OFFLINE — overlays `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=none` so git
  refuses every transport, the no-hidden-network belt; + `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) and `RunNetwork` (the
  narrow online opt-in for fetch/clone, prompt still disabled). Captures `Result{Args,Stdout,Stderr,
  ExitCode}`; non-zero exit → typed `*ExitError` carrying the full Result (so the later stderr→kind
  classifier reads it without re-running git); start failure → plain wrapped error. `setEnv` overlays
  keys by replace-not-append so git never sees a duplicate key. testenv gained `GitEnv()` to feed the
  hermetic base. Guards: `GITEXEC-OFFLINE-BELT` (two-sided, fully hermetic via a local `file://` remote:
  `ls-remote` is REFUSED with "transport 'file' not allowed" through `Run` but SUCCEEDS through
  `RunNetwork`, so the refusal is attributable to the belt) + `GITEXEC-CAPTURE` (stdout floor via `git
  version`; exit-error surfaced for an unknown subcommand). Mutants confirmed: drop the belt → offline
  `ls-remote` succeeds → `TestOfflineRefusesTransport` RED; swallow the non-zero exit → `TestRunSurfaces
  ExitError` RED. Reverted → GREEN. **Note:** this is the unit-level half of `INV-NO-NETWORK`; the
  module-wide architecture test (git-child belt asserted across all offline command paths) lands later
  in `internal/invariants`.

- **M1 · `internal/git` (SSOT keystone)** — `git.go` + `git_test.go`: deterministic typed git verbs
  on `gitexec.Runner`, all local (offline `Run`, never dial). `ResolveRef(dir, ref)` reads a verified
  commit SHA (`rev-parse --verify --end-of-options`). **`FastForwardBaseRef(dir, base, newRev)` is the
  SOLE base-ref-mutation path (DESIGN §5):** reads current `refs/heads/<base>`, checks `merge-base
  --is-ancestor <cur> <new>` (exit 1 ⇒ genuine non-ff ⇒ typed `*NonFastForwardError`, ref untouched;
  other exits ⇒ real error), then `update-ref refs/heads/<base> <new> <cur>` — **no checkout, no
  merge**, with the old value asserted so a concurrent change fails atomically rather than racing. Works
  on the detached-HEAD SSOT; v0 sync + v1 land both reuse it. Guard `GIT-FF-ONLY` (two-sided, via a
  `testenv` SSOT): a true fast-forward advances the ref; a divergent sibling commit is REFUSED with the
  ref SHA unchanged (before==after). Mutant (drop the `--is-ancestor` precheck → unconditional
  update-ref) confirmed `TestFastForwardRefusesNonFastForward` RED (divergent target advances, no
  error). Reverted → GREEN.

- **M1 · `internal/git` · `EnsureClone` + SSOT-pristine predicate** — `git.go` + `git_test.go`:
  completes the SSOT clone lifecycle on top of the keystone. `EnsureClone(dir, originURL, base)` lazily
  materializes an absent clone in the SSOT posture — `clone --branch <base>` (via the network-only
  `gitexec.RunNetwork`, the ONE permitted dial) then a local `switch --detach`, so refs/heads/<base>
  exists at the origin's base tip but is NOT checked out (advancing it via update-ref never touches a
  working tree). Idempotent: an existing repo (guarded `os.Stat` dir + `rev-parse --git-dir`) is a noop
  — no re-clone, no network. `StatusPorcelain`/`IsClean` are the SSOT-pristine check — `git status
  --porcelain`, clean iff empty, so even an UNTRACKED turd counts as drift. Guards: `GIT-CLONE-DETACHED`
  (fresh clone → HEAD abbrev-ref is `"HEAD"` AND HEAD == refs/heads/<base> tip; a sentinel file survives
  a second call, proving no re-clone) + `GIT-CLEAN` (two-sided: fresh clone clean, one untracked file
  dirty). Mutants confirmed: skip the `switch --detach` → HEAD abbrev-ref is `"main"` →
  `TestEnsureCloneDetachesAtBaseTip` RED; make `IsClean` always return true →
  `TestIsCleanReflectsWorkingTree` RED on the dirtied case. Reverted → GREEN. **`internal/git` is now
  complete** (ResolveRef / FastForwardBaseRef / EnsureClone / StatusPorcelain / IsClean).

- **M1 · `internal/mirror` (cached freshness — read/classify)** — `mirror.go` + `mirror_test.go`: the
  cached SSOT-freshness layer that feeds `mirror_freshness` in the envelope (DESIGN §5). `Snapshot`
  (comparable, all-scalar) records what the last fetch observed — `repo`/`base`/`fetched_at`/
  `local_base_sha`/`origin_base_sha`/`behind_origin_as_of_fetch` — persisted to
  `<root>/.wi/mirrors/<repo>.json` via the single atomic writer (`lockfs.WriteFileAtomic`, DESIGN §6.2)
  and read back by `Load` with **zero** network (the package imports no git/gitexec and takes no Runner,
  so a read structurally cannot dial). `Snapshot.Freshness()` projects onto `contract.MirrorFreshness`
  purely (no I/O): **`stale = behind_origin_as_of_fetch > 0`** (decision #M below). A never-fetched repo
  → `ErrNoSnapshot` so callers omit the block (≠ stale). Repo name (→ filename) routes through the
  shared `layout.ValidateSegment` chokepoint, mirroring `lock`'s `<key>.lock`-in-LocksDir pattern.
  Guards: `MIRROR-FRESHNESS` (two-sided: behind>0 stale, behind==0 fresh, carrying count + fetched_at)
  + `MIRROR-PERSIST` (Store→Load round-trip, missing→`ErrNoSnapshot`, traversing name rejected).
  Mutants confirmed: `Stale:false` hardcode → `TestFreshnessClassifiesStaleByBehindCount` RED; Store
  diverts the write (`p+".mutant"`, import kept used) → `TestSnapshotRoundTrips` RED (Load can't find
  it). Reverted → GREEN.

- **M1 · `internal/git` · `Fetch` + `DivergedCounts` (the freshness git verbs)** — `git.go` +
  `git_test.go`: the two raw git verbs the upcoming `mirror.Fetch` orchestration composes.
  **`Fetch(dir, remote)`** is the SECOND (with `EnsureClone`) network-permitted verb — it routes through
  `gitexec.RunNetwork` and updates `refs/remotes/<remote>/*` only; it never moves a local branch ref and
  never touches the working tree (advancing the SSOT base stays `FastForwardBaseRef`'s exclusive job,
  DESIGN §5). **`DivergedCounts(dir, local, remote)`** reads `rev-list --left-right --count
  local...remote` from LOCAL refs only (offline) → `(ahead, behind)`, the basis for both freshness
  (behind) and the future `main_state` classification. Guards (shared `fetchedMirror` helper: origin at
  C0, EnsureClone'd mirror, push child C1 to origin, fetch): `GIT-FETCH` (post-fetch
  `refs/remotes/origin/<base>` == C1 while `refs/heads/<base>` stays C0 AND `IsClean` true) +
  `GIT-DIVERGED` (local-vs-origin ahead 0/behind 1; reversed args flip to ahead 1/behind 0 — pins each
  count to the right column). Mutants confirmed: no-op `Fetch` (skip the dial) → tracking ref stays C0 →
  `TestFetchAdvancesRemoteTrackingOnly` RED; swap the rev-list columns → `TestDivergedCountsAheadBehind`
  RED (and `GIT-FETCH` stays green, so the swap is attributable to `DivergedCounts`). Reverted → GREEN.
  The Git-struct doc now names `EnsureClone`+`Fetch` as the only two dialing verbs.

- **M1 · `internal/mirror` · `Refresh` (the fetch orchestration)** — `fetch.go` + `fetch_test.go`:
  the one network step of the freshness layer, composing the git verbs. `Refresh(ctx, g, clk,
  mirrorsDir, repo, dir, base)`: `g.Fetch(dir, "origin")` (the dial), resolve `refs/heads/<base>`
  (local_base_sha) + `refs/remotes/origin/<base>` (origin_base_sha), `g.DivergedCounts` behind column,
  build `Snapshot{FetchedAt: clk.Now().UTC() RFC3339, ...}`, `Store`, return it. It is the ONLY part of
  `mirror` that touches git/network, so it takes `*git.Git`+`clock.Clock`; placed in a SEPARATE
  `fetch.go` so `mirror.go`'s "this file imports no git" doc stays literally true (the read path
  Load/Freshness is still Runner-free and cannot dial). Refresh does NOT advance the base ref — only the
  remote-tracking ref moves, so the SSOT tree stays pristine. Guard `MIRROR-FETCH` (testenv origin at
  C0, EnsureClone'd mirror, push C1 to origin, Refresh): behind==1 so `Freshness().Stale`, origin_base
  == C1, local_base == C0 (unmoved), fetched_at == injected fake-clock instant, `git.IsClean` holds, and
  the returned snapshot equals what `Load` reads back. Mutant (skip `g.Fetch`, classify against the
  stale tracking ref) confirmed RED on behind/stale/origin_base, reverted to GREEN. **`internal/mirror`
  is now complete** (Snapshot/Freshness/Store/Load read+classify + Refresh fetch).

- **M1 · `internal/invariants` · `INV-NO-NETWORK` (module-wide architecture test) — CLOSES M1** —
  `nonetwork_test.go`: the architecture half of DESIGN §2 #3 (the gitexec `GITEXEC-OFFLINE-BELT` unit
  proves the belt *works*; this proves the belt *cannot be bypassed*). `TestNoHiddenNetwork` walks the
  module tree (skipping `.git`, non-`.go`, and `_test.go`), derives each file's slash-separated package
  path, and — for every package NOT in `egressAllowed` — fails if it imports `os/exec` (can spawn a git
  child) or references the `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` belt key. Uses **go/parser** (not grep), so the belt key
  in a comment or this guard's own prose never false-positives; pure `scanFileForEgress(src)
  (importsExec, refsBelt)` is driven directly by the non-vacuity test. **Allowlist decision (#N below):**
  `{internal/gitexec, internal/testenv}` — gitexec is the runtime chokepoint that applies the belt;
  testenv is the test-only git-fixture harness (a non-`_test.go` support pkg never reachable from
  `cmd/wi`). Survey confirmed those are the only two source files importing `os/exec`, and
  `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` appears only in gitexec. Guard `INV-NO-NETWORK` + self-test
  `TestNoNetworkScannerIsNonVacuous` (scanner flags an `os/exec`-import source, flags a belt-key
  string-literal source, and clears a clean source). **Two mutants demonstrated** (arch tests co-locate
  detector+test, so RED-first is the mutate-demonstrate cycle, per the INV-NO-LLM precedent): empty
  `egressAllowed` → `TestNoHiddenNetwork` RED (gitexec+testenv themselves trip, proving the walk + both
  detectors fire on real source); `scanFileForEgress` always `(false,false)` → `TestNoNetworkScanner
  IsNonVacuous` RED (a blind scanner is a silent false negative). Both reverted → full `go build/vet/test`
  GREEN. **M1 is now COMPLETE** (gitexec belt + full git verbs + mirror + INV-NO-NETWORK).

- **M2 · `internal/config` (manifest read + validate) — M2 BEGINS** — `config.go` + `config_test.go`:
  the SOLE owner of the committed manifest `<root>/wi.config.jsonc` (DESIGN §1 line 19, §map line 167),
  read+validate half. `Parse([]byte) (Config, error)` strips JSONC comments then decodes with
  `encoding/json` under `DisallowUnknownFields` (closed key set — unknown key at ANY level is a hard
  error), requires exactly one JSON value (`dec.More()` guard), and validates each repo: non-empty
  `name` routed through the shared `layout.ValidateSegment("repo", …)` traversal chokepoint (names become
  `repos/<name>` segments), non-empty `url`, and an **effective base** = the repo's own `base` else
  `defaults.base` (a repo with neither is rejected); duplicate names rejected. `Load(path)` wraps
  `os.ReadFile`+`Parse` and surfaces a missing file as `fs.ErrNotExist` (so the CLI can branch to suggest
  `wi init`). Resolved `Config{Defaults, Repos}` exposes effective bases so downstream never re-applies
  the default; `Config.Lookup(name)`. `stripJSONC` is a hand-rolled state machine (normal/string/line-
  comment/block-comment, honoring `\\` escapes so a `//` inside a JSON string survives, preserving
  newlines for decoder error positions). Guard `CONFIG-PARSE`: golden manifest (comments + an inherited
  base + an explicit base) → expected typed `Config`; an 11-case reject corpus (unknown key at
  top/defaults/repo level, missing name/url, no-base-anywhere, duplicate, traversing name, malformed
  JSON, trailing content, comments-only); empty-manifest accept floor (`{"repos":[]}` and `{}`); `Load`
  round-trip + missing→`fs.ErrNotExist`. **Two mutants demonstrated:** `stripJSONC`→no-op (`return src`)
  → comment becomes a JSON syntax error → `TestParseAcceptsGolden` RED; drop `DisallowUnknownFields` →
  all 3 unknown-key cases parse cleanly → `TestParseRejectsInvalid` RED. (The "unknown repo key" case was
  strengthened with a valid `base` so it isolates `DisallowUnknownFields` rather than tripping the
  missing-base rule.) Both reverted → full `go build/vet/test` GREEN. **Decision #C** (JSONC parser =
  hand-rolled stripper + stdlib, zero new deps) recorded below. The AST-preserving *edit* path (for
  `repo add`) and trailing-comma tolerance are deferred to the writer unit.

- **M2 · `internal/state` (runtime registry — per-isolate record)** — `state.go` + `state_test.go`:
  the SOLE owner of the `.wi/state/` runtime registry (DESIGN §map line 168). `IsolateRecord{Task, OpID,
  Repos []RepoRecord}` with `RepoRecord{Repo, Stage}` is the durable entry for one isolate;
  `NewIsolateRecord(task, opID, repos)` builds every declared repo at `StagePending`. Persistence mirrors
  `internal/mirror` exactly: flat `<stateDir>/<task>.json`, task name routed through the shared
  `layout.ValidateSegment("task", …)` traversal chokepoint, `Store` = `json.MarshalIndent`+`\n`+the single
  atomic writer `lockfs.WriteFileAtomic` (§6.2), `Load` with `fs.ErrNotExist`→`ErrNoRecord` (the
  "isolate never created" sentinel, like mirror's `ErrNoSnapshot`). **`UpdateRepoStage(stateDir, task,
  repo, stage)`** is the durable-partial-success operation (DESIGN §6.3): load → flip exactly the named
  repo's stage (unknown repo is an error) → atomic re-store, called **after each worktree add** so a crash
  mid-multi-repo leaves a registry reflecting EXACTLY the completed repos. Takes no Runner and dials
  nothing (pure local persistence, like mirror); the caller holds the `isolate-state:<task>` lock around
  the load-modify-store. Guards: `STATE-PERSIST` (Store/Load round-trip with all-pending fresh start,
  missing→`ErrNoRecord`, unsafe task name rejected, `UpdateRepoStage` flips one repo + errors on unknown
  repo, flat-`<task>.json` path) + `STATE-DURABLE` (an `UpdateRepoStage` interrupted in the atomic
  writer's pre-rename crash window via `WI_FAULT=lockfs.before_rename` MUST fail and leave the PRIOR
  durable record intact — the completed flip survives, the interrupted one neither applies nor tears the
  file). **Three mutants demonstrated:** `Store` diverts the write (`p+".mutant"`) → `Load` can't find it
  → `TestRecordRoundTrips` RED; `UpdateRepoStage` skips its unknown-repo error (`found := true`) →
  flipping a non-existent repo wrongly succeeds → `TestUpdateRepoStageFlipsOneRepo` RED; `Store` swaps the
  atomic writer for `os.WriteFile` (lockfs kept referenced so the *assertion* reddens, not the compiler) →
  the injected pre-rename crash no longer aborts so the interrupted flip lands → `TestDurablePartialSuccess`
  RED. All reverted → full `go build/vet/test` GREEN. **Decision #S** (Stage is a state-owned typed string,
  not a contract enum) recorded below.

- **M2 · `internal/git` · `AddWorktree` (isolate materialization primitive)** — `git.go` +
  `git_test.go`: the per-repo verb `internal/isolate` composes to materialize one worktree off the SSOT.
  `AddWorktree(ctx, ssotDir, worktreePath, rev)` runs `git worktree add --detach <path> <rev>` (offline
  `Run`), producing a **linked worktree sharing the SSOT object store** (native git sharing — no object
  duplication, DESIGN §1 line 30) that is **detached** (holds no branch, so the SSOT base ref is never
  "checked out in a worktree" and `FastForwardBaseRef` can always advance it — the keystone, DESIGN §5).
  rev is wi-internal (a SHA or `refs/heads/<base>`); ownership/gc-protection via the
  `refs/wi/owned/<task>/<repo>` marker (DESIGN §7.1) is a separate follow-on step. Guard `GIT-WORKTREE`
  (testenv SSOT, EnsureClone'd): after add, the worktree HEAD is detached (`--abbrev-ref` == "HEAD") at
  the base tip; its `.git` is a **gitlink file** (not a dir) and `rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves to
  the **SSOT's own `.git`** (structural object-store-sharing / no-dup check, the isolation invariant PLAN
  §line 102); and the SSOT working tree stays **pristine** (`IsClean`). Mutant (materialize via a
  standalone `git clone` instead of a linked worktree) confirmed RED on **all three** assertions —
  abbrev-ref "main" (branch checked out, not detached), `.git` a directory, and the common git dir the
  clone's own (object duplication) — proving the guard verifies genuine worktree sharing, the precise
  worktree-vs-clone design choice, not merely "a checkout appeared". Reverted → full `go build/vet/test`
  GREEN. (`--detach` is defense-in-depth: a SHA or fully-qualified ref already detaches; the flag keeps a
  short-branch-name caller detached too.)

- **M2 · `internal/git` · `CreateOwnedRef` + `OwnedRefSHA` (evidence-positive ownership marker)** —
  `git.go` + `git_test.go`: the wi-owned marker-ref verbs (decision #2, DESIGN §7.1), the second
  sub-step of `internal/isolate`. **`CreateOwnedRef(ctx, ssotDir, task, repo, sha)`** atomically writes
  `refs/wi/owned/<task>/<repo>` at sha (a single `update-ref`) — the POSITIVE evidence reclamation
  requires: a worktree/branch is reclaimable only if such a marker proves wi created it; an unexplained
  orphan with no marker is a HARD BLOCK, never auto-pruned. **`OwnedRefSHA(...)` → `(sha, exists, err)`**
  reads it back via `rev-parse --verify --quiet`, cleanly distinguishing a genuinely absent marker
  (`exists=false`, nil error — the "no ownership recorded" case reclamation inspects on an orphan) from a
  real read failure (exit 1 + empty output ⇒ absent; the same `*gitexec.ExitError` exit-code idiom
  `FastForwardBaseRef` uses). The namespace lives in one place (`ownedRef`), exactly as
  `FastForwardBaseRef` owns `"refs/heads/"+base`; task/repo are caller-validated (this package holds no
  path policy). The decisive property: markers live under `refs/wi/*`, NOT `refs/heads/*`, so the commit
  is gc-reachable yet the marker is **not a branch** — the pristine SSOT never grows a stray branch
  (DESIGN §5). Guard `GIT-OWNED-REF` (testenv SSOT, EnsureClone'd): absent-before via the verb; after
  create the verb reads back the sha AND raw git confirms `refs/wi/owned/<task>/<repo>` == sha while
  `refs/heads/` still holds ONLY the base ref (no leaked branch). Mutant (flip `ownedRef`'s namespace
  `refs/wi/`→`refs/heads/`) confirmed RED on both the "lives under refs/wi at the sha" and the "no stray
  branch" assertions (refs/wi/owned empty; refs/heads/ grew `wi/owned/taskx/acme`), while the round-trip
  stayed GREEN — proving those two assertions, not the round-trip, carry the decision-#2 namespace
  property. Reverted → full `go build/vet/test` GREEN. **Decision #2** (git ref over note/reflog AND over
  a `.wi/index` backref) recorded below + marked RESOLVED in PLAN §7.

- **M2 · `internal/isolate` · `isolate.New` (the N-repo orchestration — durable partial success)** —
  `isolate.go` + `isolate_test.go`: the domain core of `wi isolate new`, the partial-success-critical
  command (DESIGN §6.3). `New(ctx, l, g, task, opID, specs)` acquires the `isolate-state:<task>` lock
  (held → `*lock.HeldError` → exit 6), `mkdir`s `isolas/<task>/`, writes a `state.NewIsolateRecord` with
  every repo `StagePending` **before any materialization** (the durable statement of intent that makes
  the op resumable), then materializes repos in request order. Each repo, in the exact evidence-positive
  order: `AddWorktree --detach` off `refs/heads/<base>` → `CreateOwnedRef` (marker BEFORE claiming
  "created", so a crash leaves a wi-owned reclaimable worktree, never an unexplained orphan, §7.1) →
  `state.UpdateRepoStage(…Created)`. **Stop-on-first-fail with durable, NOT-rolled-back completed repos:**
  the first failing repo halts the run, repos before it stay on disk + in the registry, repos after it are
  never attempted (stay `StagePending`); the result carries `StatusPartial` (→ exit 2) and the registry
  reflects EXACTLY the completed set. A per-repo failure is recorded in the `Result` (not a Go error);
  `New`'s error return is reserved for can't-run-at-all (held lock, unwritable initial record). Decoupled
  from the manifest via `isolate.RepoSpec{Name, Base}` (the CLI maps `config.Repo`→`RepoSpec`). Never
  moves a base ref / never dirties the SSOT (DESIGN §5). Guard `ISOLATE-NEW` (testenv SSOTs): (complete)
  3 repos all materialize detached, each marker records the worktree tip, durable record all `created`,
  SSOT base refs unmoved; (partial — the core) "web" has no SSOT clone so its add fails → "api" before it
  stays `created` with a durable worktree + pristine SSOT, "db" after it stays `pending` with no worktree,
  `Status==partial`, durable registry == exactly {api:created, web:pending, db:pending}; (lock) a
  pre-held `isolate-state:feat` makes `New` return `*lock.HeldError`. **Two mutants demonstrated:** drop
  the stop-on-first-fail `return` (→ `continue`) so the loop materializes "db" past the failed "web" →
  reddens exactly the 3 "db not attempted" assertions (result stage, durable stage, on-disk worktree),
  api/web/Status staying green — isolating the §6.3 stop-on-first-fail / "exactly the completed set"
  property; skip the upfront all-pending `state.Store` → the first repo's `UpdateRepoStage` errors
  `state: no isolate record` and there's no durable registry to resume from → reddens both the complete
  and partial guards (proving the durable-intent write is load-bearing). Both reverted → full
  `go build/vet/test` GREEN. **Deferred:** `isolate.New` resume (on re-run, skip repos already
  `StageCreated` rather than re-adding and failing) is a small follow-on once `resolve`/CLI land.

## Next unit (pick this on the next firing) — M2 continues

M2 (DESIGN §map: `config`, `state`, `isolate`, `resolve`) is the domain command core: committed
manifest + runtime registry + isolate create/remove/repair + the resolve path bundle. Build order
within M2: `config` ✅ → `state` ✅ → `isolate` ✅ → **`resolve`** (the last M2 unit).

- **M2 · `internal/resolve` · resolve path bundle (the last M2 unit, then M2 is COMPLETE).**
  `wi resolve <task>` (and the data behind `isolate new`'s own response) projects an existing isolate's
  per-repo worktree paths into the envelope's additive `resolve` block (`contract.ResolveBlock` /
  `ResolveRepo`, already declared in `envelope.go`). Smallest cohesive unit: a pure projector that, given
  a `layout.Layout` + a loaded `state.IsolateRecord` (via `state.Load`, so a never-created task →
  `ErrNoRecord` → the CLI maps to a not-found error/`suggest`), emits each repo's resolved
  `isolas/<task>/<repo>` absolute path + its recorded stage, WITHOUT dialing git or mutating anything
  (read-only, offline — like `mirror`'s read path). Decide whether the worktree-existence check (stat the
  path) belongs here or stays a CLI concern; lean toward: resolve reports what the registry says + the
  computed path, and flags a repo whose path is missing on disk (registry says `created` but worktree
  gone) so the agent sees drift. Fitness ideas: a `RESOLVE-PROJECTS` guard (a 2-repo created isolate →
  block lists both with the exact `layout.Isolate` paths + stages; mutant = emit the SSOT `repos/<repo>`
  path instead of the `isolas/<task>/<repo>` worktree path, or drop a repo). Honor: read-only, no network,
  paths come only from `layout` (never hand-assembled). **M2 completing unlocks M3** (`cli`/`help`/
  `suggest` + `cmd/wi` → MVP end-to-end).
- Deferred isolate follow-on: `isolate.New` **resume** — on a re-run after a partial, skip repos already
  `StageCreated` in the loaded record (Load-or-create the record instead of always Store-ing fresh)
  rather than re-adding a worktree that already exists and failing. Small, pull in once `resolve`/CLI
  exist to drive it end-to-end.

| HEAL-ATOMIC-WRITE | replace `WriteFileAtomic`'s temp+rename with an in-place `O_TRUNC` write to the final path (still honoring `FaultBeforeRename`) → under the injected crash the target is torn to the new content → `TestAtomicReplaceIsCrashSafe` RED |
| LAYOUT-BOOTSTRAP | skip the `WiSubdirs` loop in `Bootstrap` → a declared `.wi/` subdir is missing → `TestBootstrapCreatesSubtree` RED; drop `EvalSymlinks` in `Resolve` (`return New(root)`) → a symlinked root keeps its link component → `TestResolveNormalizesSymlinks` RED |
| FLOCK-EXCLUDES | take the lock with `LOCK_SH` instead of `LOCK_EX` in `FileLock.TryLock`/`Lock` → two holders coexist → `TestFlockExcludesSecondHolder` + `TestLockBlocksUntilReleased` RED |
| LOCK-KEYS | change a kind prefix (`repo:`→`repository:`, …) or the `.lock` suffix in `internal/lock/keys.go` → `TestCanonicalKeyStrings` / `TestKeyPathDerivation` RED |

| LOCK-MUTEX | treat a refused `TryLock` (`!ok`) as acquired → `TestAcquireRefusesOverlap` RED; or skip `h.Release()` rollback on refusal → `TestAcquireReleasesOnPartialFailure` RED |
| GITEXEC-OFFLINE-BELT | drop `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=none` from `Run`'s overlay → an offline `ls-remote file://…` succeeds instead of being refused → `TestOfflineRefusesTransport` RED (unit-level half of INV-NO-NETWORK) |
| INV-NO-NETWORK (architecture) | empty `egressAllowed` (or import `os/exec` / reference `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` in any non-allowlisted package) → `TestNoHiddenNetwork` RED (gitexec+testenv themselves trip, proving the walk + both detectors fire on real source) |
| INV-NO-NETWORK (detector) | make `scanFileForEgress` always return `(false,false)` → `TestNoNetworkScannerIsNonVacuous` RED (a blind scanner would be a silent false negative) |
| GITEXEC-CAPTURE | make `run` swallow a non-zero exit (return `nil` instead of `*ExitError`) → `TestRunSurfacesExitError` RED |
| GIT-FF-ONLY | drop the `merge-base --is-ancestor` precheck in `FastForwardBaseRef` (update-ref unconditionally) → a divergent target advances the base ref → `TestFastForwardRefusesNonFastForward` RED (missing error + moved ref) |
| GIT-CLONE-DETACHED | skip the `switch --detach` in `EnsureClone` (leave `<base>` checked out) → HEAD abbrev-ref is the branch name, not `"HEAD"` → `TestEnsureCloneDetachesAtBaseTip` RED |
| GIT-CLEAN | make `IsClean` ignore `StatusPorcelain` and always return `true` → an untracked file no longer reads as drift → `TestIsCleanReflectsWorkingTree` RED |
| GIT-FETCH | make `Fetch` a no-op (return nil without running `git fetch`) → the remote-tracking ref stays at the old tip → `TestFetchAdvancesRemoteTrackingOnly` RED |
| GIT-DIVERGED | swap the two `rev-list --left-right --count` columns in `DivergedCounts` (read ahead from `fields[1]`, behind from `fields[0]`) → `TestDivergedCountsAheadBehind` RED |
| GIT-WORKTREE | materialize via a standalone `git clone <ssotDir> <path>` instead of `git worktree add --detach` in `AddWorktree` → the result checks out `main` (not detached) and has its own `.git` dir + object store (common-dir ≠ SSOT) → `TestAddWorktreeIsDetachedLinkedAndShared` RED on all three assertions (proves the guard verifies genuine linked-worktree sharing, not just a checkout) |
| GIT-OWNED-REF | flip the namespace `refs/wi/`→`refs/heads/` in `ownedRef` → the marker becomes a stray branch: `refs/wi/owned/` is empty while `refs/heads/` grows a second ref → `TestOwnedRefMarksOwnershipUnderRefsWi` RED on both the "lives under refs/wi at the sha" and "no stray branch" assertions (the round-trip stays GREEN, isolating the decision-#2 namespace property; a no-op `CreateOwnedRef` additionally reddens the absent→present round-trip) |
| MIRROR-FETCH | make `Refresh` skip the `g.Fetch` dial (classify against the stale remote-tracking ref) → behind stays 0, origin_base == local_base, not stale → `TestRefreshFetchesAndClassifies` RED |
| MIRROR-FRESHNESS | hardcode `Stale:false` (or `true`) in `Snapshot.Freshness()`, ignoring the behind count → `TestFreshnessClassifiesStaleByBehindCount` RED (two-sided: a constant fails one branch) |

| STATE-PERSIST | make `Store` divert the write (`p+".mutant"`) so `Load` can't find it → `TestRecordRoundTrips` RED; or make `UpdateRepoStage` skip its unknown-repo error (`found := true`) so flipping a non-existent repo wrongly succeeds → `TestUpdateRepoStageFlipsOneRepo` RED |
| STATE-DURABLE | replace `lockfs.WriteFileAtomic` with `os.WriteFile` in `Store` (keep `lockfs` referenced so the assertion, not the compiler, reddens) → the injected `WI_FAULT=lockfs.before_rename` no longer aborts so the interrupted flip lands → `TestDurablePartialSuccess` RED |
| ISOLATE-NEW | drop the stop-on-first-fail `return` in `isolate.New` (turn it into `continue`) → the loop materializes the repo AFTER the failed one → `TestNewStopsOnFirstFailWithDurablePartialSuccess` RED on the 3 "db not attempted" assertions (result stage, durable stage, on-disk worktree); or skip the upfront all-pending `state.Store` → the first repo's `UpdateRepoStage` finds no record (`state: no isolate record`) and no durable registry exists to resume from → both `TestNewMaterializesAllReposComplete` + `TestNewStopsOnFirstFail…` RED |

## Decisions taken (from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §7 open decisions)

- **#M `mirror_freshness.stale` predicate — RESOLVED 2026-06-30** (not one of the 7 §7 rulings; §7 #1
  only fixed that staleness lives in the structured field, not a warning). `stale = true` **iff
  `behind_origin_as_of_fetch > 0`** — the most current offline-knowable signal, since wi never
  auto-fetches. Rejected a time-based TTL (would need a clock policy or a dial; no TTL exists anywhere
  in the spec). The `stale` bool and the count are non-redundant — the count is `,omitempty` (absent at
  0), so `stale` is the stable field agents branch on. Never-fetched repo → `mirror.ErrNoSnapshot` →
  the `mirror_freshness` block is omitted entirely (≠ "fresh"). Recorded in DESIGN §5.

- **#S `internal/state` stage vocabulary ownership — RESOLVED 2026-06-30** (not one of the 7 §7
  rulings; the spec names the registry but fixes no stage type). The per-repo isolate `Stage`
  (`StagePending` → `StageCreated`) is a small typed-string vocabulary **owned by `internal/state`, NOT a
  closed `internal/contract` enum.** Rationale: the contract owns only the closed *wire* enums, and the
  envelope's `RepoResult.Stage` is already an intentionally free-form `string` projection (confirmed in
  `envelope.go`) — so a closed contract enum would over-constrain a field the contract deliberately left
  open. The v0 isolate lifecycle is `pending → created`; the land-phase vocabulary
  (`pending|landed|blocked`) is a SEPARATE `landstate` concern for v1 and is deliberately not conflated
  with the isolate-materialization stage. If a stage value ever needs to surface as a *closed* envelope
  enum, it moves to `internal/contract` then (per the standing "closed enums live in contract" rule).
  Recorded in the `internal/state` package doc.

- **#C `wi.config.jsonc` parser + manifest schema — RESOLVED 2026-06-30** (not one of the 7 §7 rulings;
  DESIGN names the file `.jsonc` and "repos, defaults, policy" but fixes no field-level schema or parser
  choice). **Parser:** hand-rolled JSONC comment stripper + stdlib `encoding/json` with
  `DisallowUnknownFields`, **zero new deps** — consistent with decision #6 (zero-dep posture) and keeping
  INV-NO-LLM trivially green; a JSONC library was rejected for the read path. **Schema (v0, minimal,
  closed):** top-level `{ defaults?, repos? }`; `defaults` = `{ base }`; each repo = `{ name, url, base? }`
  with effective base = repo `base` else `defaults.base`. Following the SHAPE-SCHEMA precedent (don't
  pre-declare reserved blocks), `policy` and a manifest `version` field are NOT added speculatively —
  they land with their feature at a documented bump. **Deferred:** the AST-preserving *edit* path (for
  `repo add`, DESIGN §line 204) and trailing-comma tolerance are a separate writer unit; this unit is
  read+validate only. Recorded in the `internal/config` package doc.

- **#N INV-NO-NETWORK egress allowlist — RESOLVED 2026-06-30** (not one of the 7 §7 rulings; the
  enforcement form of DESIGN §2 #3). The architecture guard permits `os/exec` import + `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`
  reference only in `{internal/gitexec, internal/testenv}`. **gitexec** is the runtime chokepoint that
  launches every git child and applies the belt; **testenv** is the test-only git-fixture harness — a
  non-`_test.go` support package (so the `_test.go` skip doesn't cover it) that runs git directly via
  `exec.Command`, but is never reachable from `cmd/wi`, so it never ships in a command path. A tree survey
  confirmed those are the only two source files importing `os/exec`, and `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` appears
  nowhere but gitexec. Scope rule: **go/parser AST scan** (not a token/grep scan) so the belt key inside a
  comment or this guard's own prose can't false-positive; detection is import-of-`os/exec` + belt-key
  string-literal, which is stricter and simpler than tracing `RunNetwork` reachability and needs no
  caller allowlist. Recorded here + in the `nonetwork_test.go` header.

- **#2 Marker-ref mechanism — RESOLVED 2026-06-30** (one of the 7 §7 open decisions). The
  evidence-positive ownership marker reclamation requires (DESIGN §7.1) is a **git ref**
  `refs/wi/owned/<task>/<repo>`, chosen over a git note/reflog AND over a `.wi/index` backref. A ref
  gives **atomic creation** (a single `update-ref`) and **gc-protection** (a ref keeps its commit
  reachable) while living under `refs/wi/*`, NOT `refs/heads/*` — so the marker is never a branch and
  the pristine SSOT (DESIGN §5) never grows a stray branch. The `.wi/index` backref alternative was
  rejected: it would be a second, non-atomic source of ownership truth that could drift from git's own
  ref store and is not gc-aware (git wouldn't protect the referenced objects from a `gc --prune`).
  Implemented as `git.CreateOwnedRef(ctx, ssotDir, task, repo, sha)` (write) + `git.OwnedRefSHA(...)`
  (read, returning `(sha, exists, err)` with a clean absent case), guard `GIT-OWNED-REF`. Recorded here
  + DESIGN §7.1 (already specified the ref) + PLAN §7 #2 (now struck through).

- **#1 `capabilities[]` + warning-code token sets — RESOLVED 2026-06-29.** Capabilities v0 =
  `{help-json, resolve-block, dry-run, partial-success}` (pinned in `Capabilities()`). Warning-code
  v0 = closed `{hydrate_skipped, base_behind_ssot}` (`AllWarningCodes()`), MVP-wired + offline-knowable
  only; staleness stays structured in `mirror_freshness.stale`. Recorded in DESIGN §8 + PLAN §7.

- **#6 Go libs sign-off (lockfs) — RESOLVED 2026-06-30: zero new deps, BOTH halves hand-rolled.**
  The §7 recommendation was "adopt `gofrs/flock` + `google/renameio`"; both legs were overridden to
  zero-dep hand-rolls with concrete rationale (not reflexive NIH).
  - **`WriteFileAtomic`** (not `google/renameio`): the unit's entire fitness is crash-safety, *proven*
    by injecting `WI_FAULT` exactly between the temp write and the rename; a library hides that
    boundary, so the non-vacuity mutant could not be expressed. DESIGN's §M0 file-list already
    specifies the manual recipe and §7 lists hand-rolled as the explicit alternative.
  - **`FileLock`** (not `gofrs/flock`): decided at `flock_unix.go` implementation time (the earlier
    entry deferred this leg pending implementation — not a flip-flop). wi's lock path is unix-only,
    `syscall.Flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` is exactly the BSD-flock primitive (pure stdlib ⇒ INV-NO-LLM
    trivially green, no supply-chain surface), and the PID/`boot_id` lock-content + §7.3 auto-break
    self-heal are hand-written regardless, so a library would wrap only one syscall.
  Net: `go.mod` gains no runtime dependency from M0. Owner may override either leg. Recorded in
  DESIGN §6.2 + PLAN §7.

- **#A op_id encoding specifics — RESOLVED 2026-06-29** (DESIGN §3.1 fixed the skeleton
  `op_<base36ts>_<base32rand>` + `.<n>`; these fill the unspecified gaps). Time unit = Unix
  **milliseconds** (rough chronology + human-debuggable, distinct from s/ns). Random = **5 bytes**
  → 8 chars lowercase unpadded standard base32 (`[a-z2-7]`); plenty of within-ms collision
  resistance. Child index **n ≥ 1, no leading zero**; children nest (`.1.2`). op_id is not required
  to be lexicographically sortable (uniqueness comes from the random half). Recorded in DESIGN §8 row
  + `internal/cli/opid` doc comment.
