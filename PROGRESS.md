# wi — BUILD PROGRESS

Working log for the autonomous build loop. Source of truth for *intent*; the real
build state is always `go build ./... && go test ./...` (trust the build over this file).

Branch: `build/wi` (never commit to `main`). Spec: `DESIGN.md`. Order: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

---

## Current position

- **Milestone:** M0 (contract spine) — in progress
- **Wave:** A (contract spine, precedes all domain code)

## Done

- **M0/A · contract enums** — `internal/contract/enums.go`: closed sets `Action` (6),
  `ErrorKind` (11), `ExitCode` (9), `Capability` (10 vocab / 4 advertised) + `SchemaVersion`.
  Guard `SHAPE-ENUM-DOUBLE-ENTRY` (`enums_test.go`): independent literal copies; drift /
  duplicate / subset checks; inline non-vacuity proof. Real-source mutant (added `"timeout"`
  to `AllErrorKinds`) confirmed RED, then reverted → GREEN.
- **M0/A · Envelope wire type** — `internal/contract/envelope.go`: the `Envelope` struct with
  locked field declaration order + custom `MarshalJSON` enforcing `error:null` (never omitted)
  and `repos`/`capabilities`/`warnings`/`next` always-`[]` (never null). Nested wire types
  `RepoResult`, `MirrorFreshness`, `Warning`, `Error`, `ResolveBlock`, `ResolveRepo`, `PlanItem`,
  `BlockItem` (additive blocks `resolve`/`planned`/`blocked` are omitempty per DESIGN §3.1).
  Guard `SHAPE-ENVELOPE-INVARIANTS` (`envelope_test.go`): golden success/error bytes,
  error-always-present, repos-always-array, frozen 11-key top-level order + a non-vacuous
  order-extractor proof. Mutant (added `,omitempty` to `Error`) confirmed RED on
  `TestEnvelopeGoldenSuccess`/`TestEnvelopeErrorAlwaysPresent`, then reverted → GREEN.

## Next unit (pick this on the next firing)

- **M0/A · Envelope JSON Schema SSOT** — `schema/envelope.schema.json` (draft 2020-12,
  `additionalProperties:false`) as the published shape SSOT + `SHAPE-SCHEMA` validation guard
  (validate the golden success/error envelopes against the schema; needs
  `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema` v6 — first external dep). The schema must mirror the locked
  field set and `required` must list all 11 top-level keys incl. `error`.
- Then: `SHAPE-FINGERPRINT` (sha256 schema↔struct tripwire so neither side drifts silently)
  + `testdata/contract.lock.json`.
- Before the schema locks: settle open decision #1 (warning-code vocabulary starter set), since
  `Warning.Code` needs a closed enum to validate against. Adopt the documented recommendation.

## Mutant registry (guard → mutant that must turn it RED)

| guard | mutant |
|-------|--------|
| SHAPE-ENUM-DOUBLE-ENTRY | add/reorder a value in any `All*()` without editing the `want*()` literal copy |
| SHAPE-ENVELOPE-INVARIANTS | add `,omitempty` to `Envelope.Error`, or drop the nil→`[]` coercion for repos/capabilities/warnings/next in `MarshalJSON` |

## Decisions taken (from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §7 open decisions)

- *(none yet — first open decision needed is the `capabilities[]` + warning-code token set,
  which blocks M0 finalization. Capabilities vocab is already pinned in `enums.go`; warning-code
  vocab still TODO before the Envelope/schema unit locks.)*

## Conventions

- Module: `github.com/ggkguelensan/workspace-isolation`, Go 1.26.
- Every fitness/guard test names its mutant in the registry above; confirm RED→GREEN per unit.
- Commit one coherent unit at a time, conventional commits, Co-Authored-By trailer. No push / no PR.
